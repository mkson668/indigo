<p>My passion for programming started while I was in UBC studying as a Biology undergraduate. I found coding an extremely verstile tool that could be applied to many of my coursework tasks. For instance, I was able to automate data collection or perform machine learning algortims to perform data analysis. Ultimately, this newfound interest motivated me to transition to a degree in Computer Science instead.</p>

<p>My main interests include cloud computing and machine learning. I am always keen on learning about new IT trends to improve myself, and lately, I've been venturing into the realm of mobile 
development!</p>

<p>
Currently, I am seeking an employment opportunity at a reputable organization to showcase my 
technical skills for the growth of the company as well as to increase my expertise in the IT sector.</p>
